# Detecting Virtual Machines and Sandbox

### What Are Virtual Machines and Sandboxes?

**Virtual Machines (VMs)**:

VMs are software-based emulations of physical computers, allowing multiple operating systems to run on the same physical machine. VMs provide a flexible, isolated environment for running applications and are widely used for:

- **Software testing**
- **System administration**
- **Cloud computing**
- **Malware analysis**

Some of the most commonly used **VM platforms** include:

- **VMware**
- **VirtualBox**
- **Hyper-V**
- **QEMU**
- **Parallels**

**Sandboxes**:

A sandbox is an isolated environment used for running potentially dangerous applications or conducting security testing. Sandboxes are critical for isolating threats, enabling researchers to analyze malware or test new software without risking the host system. Popular sandbox platforms include:

- **Any.Run**
- **Cuckoo Sandbox**
- **FireEye**

### Why Is Detecting Virtual Machines Important?

Malware analysts routinely examine suspicious code in isolated environments like virtual machines (VMs) or sandboxes. Security products also use these environments to analyze potentially malicious code through dynamic analysis before allowing it into an organization's network. This analysis reveals the malware's TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), which are then used for detection.

Malware developers actively try to prevent this analysis by designing their code to detect virtual and sandbox environments. When detected, the malware will hide its malicious behavior.

we will delve into various methods for detecting virtual environments, focusing on both **hardware-based** and **software-based** techniques. Virtualization platforms, such as virtual machines (VMs) and sandboxes, can often be identified through specific indicators. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to efficiently identify virtual machines and sandboxes using a variety of detection methods, automating the process for optimal results.

### **Techniques for Detecting Virtual Environments**

### **1. Software-Based Detection**

### 1.1 **MAC Address Detection**

One of the easiest ways to detect virtual machines is by examining the **MAC address** of the network adapters. Many VM platforms use specific **MAC address prefixes** for their virtual network adapters. For example:

- **VMware**: `00:05:69`, `00:0C:29`, `00:50:56`
- **VirtualBox**: `08:00:27`
- **QEMU**: `52:54:00`
- **Parallels**: `00:1C:42`
- **Xen**: `00:16:3E`
- **Hyper-V**: `00-15-5D`

By checking the MAC address of the network adapters on the system, you can identify if the system is running inside a VM. This can be done easily with a PowerShell script or through a manual inspection of network settings.

```powershell
# Detect VM MAC Addresses
$vmMacPrefixes = @("00-15-5D","00:05:69", "00:0C:29", "00:50:56", "08:00:27", "52:54:00", "00:1C:42", "00:16:3E")
$isVmDetected = $false
$results = @{}

# Get all network interfaces
$networkAdapters = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration | Where-Object { $_.IPEnabled }

foreach ($adapter in $networkAdapters) {
    $macAddress = $adapter.MACAddress.ToUpper()
    foreach ($prefix in $vmMacPrefixes) {
        if ($macAddress.StartsWith($prefix)) {
            $isVmDetected = $true
            $results[$adapter.Description] = $macAddress
        }
    }
}

if ($isVmDetected) {
    Write-Host "VM-related MAC Address Detected!"
    foreach ($key in $results.Keys) {
        Write-Host "Adapter: $key | MAC Address: $($results[$key])"
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "No VM-related MAC addresses detected."
}

```

### 1.2 **Checking for Virtualization Software Processes and Services**

Another method of detecting VMs is to look for **specific processes** or **services** that are commonly associated with virtualization software. For example:

- **VMware**: `vmware.exe`
- **VirtualBox**: `VBoxService.exe`

These processes or services are usually running on the system if a VM is detected. By querying the running processes in Windows, you can identify these virtualization tools.

```powershell
$virtualProcesses = @(
    "vmware.exe", "VBoxService.exe", "VBoxTray.exe", "vmms.exe", 
    "vmtoolsd.exe", "vmwaretrat.exe", "vmwareuser.exe", "vmacthlp.exe"
)

$virtualServices = @(
    "VMwareTools", "VBoxService", "vmmemctl", 
    "VMTools", "Vmhgfs", "VMMEMCTL", "Vmmouse", "Vmrawdsk", "Vmusbmouse", 
    "Vmvss", "Vmscsi", "Vmxnet", "vmx_svga", 
    "Vmware Tools", "Vmware Physical Disk Helper Service"
)

# Check running processes
$runningProcesses = Get-Process | Where-Object { $virtualProcesses -contains $_.Name }

# Check running services
$runningServices = Get-Service | Where-Object { $virtualServices -contains $_.Name }

if ($runningProcesses) {
    Write-Host "Virtualization-related processes detected:"
    $runningProcesses | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.Name }
} else {
    Write-Host "No virtualization processes detected."
}

if ($runningServices) {
    Write-Host "Virtualization-related services detected:"
    $runningServices | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.Name }
} else {
    Write-Host "No virtualization services detected."
}

```

### 1.3 **Examining Registry Keys**

Virtualization platforms often leave specific **registry entries** or settings in the Windows Registry. For example, VMware and Hyper-V add specific keys to the system registry that can be checked to confirm if the system is running in a virtualized environment.

By inspecting these registry keys, you can verify whether a VM platform is installed and running.

```powershell
# VM-related registry paths to check
$vmRegistryPaths = @(
    "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.",
    "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Virtual Machine"
)

# Check if VM-related registry paths exist
foreach ($path in $vmRegistryPaths) {
    if (Test-Path $path) {
        Write-Host "VM-related registry key found: $path"
    } else {
        Write-Host "No VM-related registry key at $path"
    }
}

# Define a list of known registry keys and values for virtualization platforms
$registryPaths = @(
    @{Key = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\vmhgfs"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\vmmouse"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "HKLM:\HARDWARE\ACPI\DSDT\VBOX__"; Name = ""; Platform = "VirtualBox"},
    @{Key = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\VBoxGuest"; Name = ""; Platform = "VirtualBox"},
    @{Key = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Hyper-V"; Name = ""; Platform = "Hyper-V"},
    
    # New VMware-specific registry keys
    @{Key = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\Vmware Tools"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port 2\Scsi Bus 0\Target Id 0\Logical Unit Id 0\Identifier"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\SCSI\Disk&Ven_VMware_&Prod_VMware_Virtual_S"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CriticalDeviceDatabase\root#vmwvmcihostdev"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"},
    @{Key = "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\VirtualDeviceDrivers"; Name = ""; Platform = "VMware"}
)

# Function to check if a registry key exists
function Check-RegistryKey {
    param (
        [string]$keyPath,
        [string]$valueName
    )
    try {
        if (Test-Path $keyPath) {
            if ($valueName -eq "") {
                return $true
            } else {
                $value = Get-ItemProperty -Path $keyPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                if ($value) {
                    return $true
                }
            }
        }
    } catch {
        return $false
    }
    return $false
}

# Initialize detection results
$foundArtifacts = @()

# Scan registry paths for virtualization artifacts
foreach ($entry in $registryPaths) {
    if (Check-RegistryKey -keyPath $entry.Key -valueName $entry.Name) {
        $foundArtifacts += $entry
    }
}

# Display results
if ($foundArtifacts.Count -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "`nDetected virtualization artifacts in registry:" -ForegroundColor Green
    foreach ($artifact in $foundArtifacts) {
        Write-Host "Platform: $($artifact.Platform), Key: $($artifact.Key)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "`nNo virtualization artifacts detected in the registry." -ForegroundColor Cyan
}

```

### 1.4 **Network Traffic and Connections**

Virtualized environments often exhibit different network behaviors compared to physical machines. By analyzing **network traffic** and **connections**, you might observe patterns indicative of a VM. For example:

- Specific IP address ranges associated with VM host networks.
- Unusual or non-standard network traffic patterns often used for VM isolation.

While this is less straightforward than the previous methods, analyzing network behavior can be an additional technique to help confirm if a system is virtualized.

### 1.5 **System Manufacturer Check**

The **system manufacturer** is often a telltale sign that a system is virtualized. Most virtual environments modify the manufacturer field to indicate the virtual machine platform. By using PowerShell’s `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet, you can retrieve this information from the **Win32_ComputerSystem** class.

For example:

- **VMware** often shows `VMware, Inc.` as the manufacturer.
- **Hyper-V** shows `Microsoft Corporation.`
- **VirtualBox** may show a generic name like `innotek GmbH.`

By checking the system manufacturer, you can get a quick clue as to whether you are running in a virtual machine or physical hardware.

```powershell
# Get system manufacturer information from the Win32_ComputerSystem class
$systemInfo = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem
$manufacturer = $systemInfo.Manufacturer

# Display the manufacturer information
Write-Host "System Manufacturer: $manufacturer"

# Check for known virtual environments
if ($manufacturer -match "VMware|VirtualBox|Microsoft Corporation|QEMU|Parallels|Xen|innotek GmbH") {
    Write-Host "The system appears to be running in a virtualized environment."
} else {
    Write-Host "No virtualized environment detected based on the system manufacturer."
}

```

### 1.6 **Detecting Virtual Machine Drivers**

Virtual environments often require specific drivers to function, especially for hardware emulation. These drivers can sometimes be used as indicators of virtual machine presence. Common VM-specific drivers include:

- **VMware**: `vmci.sys` (VMware Common Interface driver), `vmmemctl.sys` (VMware Balloon driver)
- **VirtualBox**: `VBoxGuest.sys` (VirtualBox guest additions), `VBoxMouse.sys` (VirtualBox mouse driver)
- **Hyper-V**: `vmbus.sys` (Virtual Machine Bus), `hvnetvsc.sys` (Hyper-V network driver)

You can check for these drivers by querying the system’s driver list to see if any are loaded, which would indicate that the system is running in a virtualized environment.

```powershell
# Detecting Virtual Machine Drivers
$vmDrivers = @(
    "vmci.sys",         # VMware Common Interface driver
    "vmmemctl.sys",     # VMware Balloon driver
    "VBoxGuest.sys",    # VirtualBox Guest Additions driver
    "VBoxMouse.sys",    # VirtualBox mouse driver
    "vmbus.sys",        # Hyper-V Virtual Machine Bus driver
    "hvnetvsc.sys",     # Hyper-V Network Virtual Service Client
    "qemu-ga.sys",      # QEMU Guest Agent driver
    "xen.sys"           # Xen Virtualization Platform driver
)

# Query the list of drivers on the system
$drivers = Get-WmiObject Win32_SystemDriver

Write-Host "Checking for virtual machine-related drivers..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
$vmDriverDetected = $false

foreach ($driver in $drivers) {
    if ($vmDrivers -contains $driver.Name) {
        Write-Host "Detected VM Driver: $($driver.Name) - Display Name: $($driver.DisplayName)" -ForegroundColor Red
        $vmDriverDetected = $true
    }
}

if (-not $vmDriverDetected) {
    Write-Host "No Virtual Machine-related drivers detected." -ForegroundColor Green
}

```

### 1.7 **Suspicious File System Artifacts**

Another method of detection involves analyzing the file system for **VM-specific files** or artifacts. Some virtualization platforms leave behind traces of their virtual disk images, configuration files, or logs that can be easily detected. Here are some common examples:

- **VMware**: Files like `vmware.log`, `vmx`, `vmdk`, and `nvram`
- **VirtualBox**: Files like `.vbox`, `.vdi`, `.vbox-extpack`
- **QEMU**: Files like `.qcow2`, `.img`
- **Hyper-V**: Files like `.vhd`, `.vhdx`, `.avhdx`

If you find these files in directories where they shouldn’t normally be, it could indicate the system is running in a virtual machine. You can scan the system’s file system for these VM-specific file extensions.

```powershell
# Define suspicious file artifacts for various virtualization platforms
$suspiciousFiles = @(
    # VMware artifacts
    "*.vmware.log",
    "*.vmx",
    "*.vmdk",
    "*.nvram",
    
    # VirtualBox artifacts
    "*.vbox",
    "*.vdi",
    "*.vbox-extpack",
    "*.VBox.log",          # VirtualBox VM log files
    "*.VBoxSVC.log",       # VirtualBox service log files
    "*.VBoxStartup.log",   # VirtualBox startup log files
    
    # QEMU artifacts
    "*.qcow2",
    "*.img",
    
    # Hyper-V artifacts (Common file extensions and virtual disk files)
    "*.vhd",
    "*.vhdx",
    "*.avhdx",
    
    # Hyper-V Log files (usually in Event Tracing Log format)
    "*.etl",
    "*.txt",  # Hyper-V may have logs in .txt format for some operations
    "*.log"   # General log files that might contain VM-specific logs
)

# Additional suspicious files for VMware and VirtualBox drivers
$suspiciousDriverFiles = @(
    # VMware driver files
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\Vmmouse.sys",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vm3dgl.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmdum.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vm3dver.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmtray.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\VMToolsHook.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmmousever.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmhgfs.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmGuestLib.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\VmGuestLibJava.dll",
    "C:\windows\System32\Drivers\vmhgfs.dll",

    # VirtualBox driver files

    "C:\windows\System32\vboxservice.exe",
    "C:\windows\System32\vboxtray.exe",
    "C:\windows\System32\VBoxControl.exe"
)

# Function to scan for suspicious files in specific directories
function Scan-SuspiciousFiles {
    param (
        [string]$searchPath = "C:\"  # Default search directory (root of C: drive)
    )

    foreach ($filePattern in $suspiciousFiles) {
        Write-Host "Scanning for: $filePattern"
        # Search recursively for files that match the suspicious patterns
        $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $searchPath -Recurse -Filter $filePattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        if ($files) {
            Write-Host "Suspicious files found:"
            $files | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }
        } else {
            Write-Host "No suspicious files found for: $filePattern"
        }
    }
}

# Function to scan for suspicious VM files and directories
function Scan-VMArtifacts {
    param (
        [string]$searchPath = "C:\"  # Default path to scan (root of C: drive)
    )

    # Scan for suspicious virtual machine files and directories
    foreach ($pattern in $suspiciousFilesAndDirs) {
        Write-Host "Scanning for: $pattern"
        # Check for files matching the pattern
        $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $searchPath -Recurse -Filter $pattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        if ($files) {
            Write-Host "Suspicious files or directories found:"
            $files | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }
        } else {
            Write-Host "No suspicious files or directories found for: $pattern"
        }
    }

    # Scan for suspicious VMware and VirtualBox driver files
    foreach ($driverFile in $suspiciousDriverFiles) {
        Write-Host "Scanning for driver: $driverFile"
        if (Test-Path $driverFile) {
            Write-Host "VMware or VirtualBox driver found: $driverFile"
        } else {
            Write-Host "No driver found for: $driverFile"
        }
    }
}

# Example usage: Scan the C: drive
Scan-SuspiciousFiles "C:\"
Scan-VMArtifacts
```

### 

### **2. Hardware-Based Detection**

### 2.1 **CPU Features**

Virtualization platforms often expose specific CPU flags or features that can be detected from the host system. These flags are used to enable or optimize virtualization on the CPU, and they can sometimes reveal that the system is running inside a virtual machine. These flags include:

- **Intel VT-x**: The Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x) flag is a hardware feature present on Intel processors that support hardware virtualization.
- **AMD SVM**: The AMD Secure Virtual Machine (SVM) feature is AMD's equivalent to Intel VT-x.
- **Hypervisor Present Flag**: On some systems, the CPU will expose a "hypervisor" flag in its CPUID instruction to indicate that the system is running under a hypervisor.

### 2.2 **BIOS/EFI Information**

Some virtualization platforms expose specific identifiers in the system's BIOS or firmware settings that reveal the virtualized nature of the environment. When a system boots, it reads information from the BIOS/UEFI, which may contain entries indicating the presence of a virtual machine.

For example:

- **VMware**: Often adds a "VMware" identifier to the BIOS string or specific firmware settings.
- **Hyper-V**: May add a "Microsoft Corporation" string to the BIOS information.
- **VirtualBox**: Often includes "VirtualBox" as part of the BIOS information.
- **QEMU**: May add "QEMU" or related identifiers in the BIOS strings.

You can query the **BIOS version** or **BIOS manufacturer** using PowerShell to look for any signs that the system is running inside a VM.like **`System Manufacturer Check`**

```powershell
# Function to check for virtual machine indicators in BIOS/UEFI information
function Check-BIOSInfo {
    # Retrieve the BIOS information using WMI
    $bios = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_BIOS

    # Get the BIOS manufacturer and version
    $biosManufacturer = $bios.Manufacturer
    $biosVersion = $bios.SMBIOSBIOSVersion
    $biosReleaseDate = $bios.ReleaseDate

    # Check for common virtual machine indicators in BIOS/UEFI
    $vmIndicators = @("VMware", "Microsoft Corporation", "VirtualBox", "QEMU")

    # Initialize a flag to check if a VM-related identifier is found
    $isVM = $false

    # Check if any of the indicators are found in the BIOS manufacturer or version
    foreach ($indicator in $vmIndicators) {
        if ($biosManufacturer -match $indicator -or $biosVersion -match $indicator) {
            $isVM = $true
            Write-Host "VM-related identifier found in BIOS/UEFI: $indicator"
        }
    }

    # Output the BIOS information
    Write-Host "BIOS Manufacturer: $biosManufacturer"
    Write-Host "BIOS Version: $biosVersion"
    Write-Host "BIOS Release Date: $biosReleaseDate"

    # Final result
    if ($isVM) {
        Write-Host "This system appears to be running inside a virtual machine."
    } else {
        Write-Host "No virtual machine indicators found in BIOS/UEFI."
    }
}

# Run the function to check BIOS/UEFI information
Check-BIOSInfo

```

### 2.3 **Low-Level Hardware Detection**

Some advanced methods involve **direct hardware queries**. For instance, you can use the **PCI bus** or **USB controllers** to check for devices that might be specific to virtual machines. Many VMs use virtualized devices such as:

- **PCI devices**: Devices like virtualized network cards (`vmxnet`), virtual storage controllers, etc.
- **USB Controllers**: Some VMs expose virtualized USB controllers.

This level of detection often requires tools that can interact with the hardware directly, such as using **Windows Device Manager** or specialized tools like [**`Sysinternals`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) utilities, which provide more granular details.

```powershell
# Unified function to check for all virtualized devices, including network adapters
function Check-AllVirtualizedDevices {
    Write-Host "Checking for virtualized devices..."

    # Initialize a flag to track if any virtualized devices are found
    $foundVirtualDevices = $false

    # Check for virtualized PCI devices (e.g., vmxnet, Hyper-V, etc.)
    $pciDevices = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity | Where-Object {
        $_.DeviceID -match "PCI" -and (
            $_.Description -match "vmxnet" -or
            $_.Description -match "Virtual" -or
            $_.DeviceID -match "VMware" -or
            $_.DeviceID -match "QEMU" -or
            $_.Description -match "Hyper-V" -or
            $_.DeviceID -match "vmbus"
        )
    }

    # If virtualized PCI devices are found, display them
    if ($pciDevices) {
        Write-Host "Virtualized PCI devices found:"
        $pciDevices | ForEach-Object {
            Write-Host "Device: $($_.Description) - Device ID: $($_.DeviceID)"
        }
        $foundVirtualDevices = $true
    }

    # Check for virtualized USB controllers (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware, etc.)
    $usbControllers = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_USBHub | Where-Object {
        $_.Description -match "Virtual" -or
        $_.Description -match "USB Virtual" -or
        $_.DeviceID -match "VMware" -or
        $_.DeviceID -match "QEMU" -or
        $_.Description -match "Hyper-V" -or
        $_.DeviceID -match "vmbus"
    }

    # If virtualized USB controllers are found, display them
    if ($usbControllers) {
        Write-Host "Virtualized USB controllers found:"
        $usbControllers | ForEach-Object {
            Write-Host "Device: $($_.Description) - Device ID: $($_.DeviceID)"
        }
        $foundVirtualDevices = $true
    }

    # Check for Hyper-V specific virtual devices (e.g., Hyper-V Network Adapter, vmbus)
    $hypervDevices = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity | Where-Object {
        $_.Description -match "Hyper-V" -or
        $_.DeviceID -match "vmbus" -or
        $_.Description -match "Hyper-V Network Adapter"
    }

    # If Hyper-V virtual devices are found, display them
    if ($hypervDevices) {
        Write-Host "Hyper-V virtual devices found:"
        $hypervDevices | ForEach-Object {
            Write-Host "Device: $($_.Description) - Device ID: $($_.DeviceID)"
        }
        $foundVirtualDevices = $true
    }

    # Check for virtualized network adapters (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, QEMU)
    $networkAdapters = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapter | Where-Object {
        $_.Description -match "VMware" -or
        $_.Description -match "Hyper-V" -or
        $_.Description -match "VirtualBox" -or
        $_.Description -match "QEMU" -or
        $_.Description -match "vEthernet" -or
        $_.DeviceID -match "vmbus"
    }

    # If virtualized network adapters are found, display them
    if ($networkAdapters) {
        Write-Host "Virtualized network adapters found:"
        $networkAdapters | ForEach-Object {
            Write-Host "Adapter: $($_.Description) - Device ID: $($_.DeviceID)"
        }
        $foundVirtualDevices = $true
    }

    # If no virtual devices are found, output a message
    if (-not $foundVirtualDevices) {
        Write-Host "No virtualized devices detected."
    }
}

# Run the check for all virtualized devices
Check-AllVirtualizedDevices

```

### 2.4 **Performance and System Behavior**

Virtual machines often have different performance characteristics compared to physical systems due to the additional abstraction layer that virtualization introduces. Certain performance metrics, like CPU, disk, and network performance, can provide subtle clues that a system is running inside a VM.

Some common signs of virtual machine performance include:

- **CPU Performance**: VMs often have lower CPU performance compared to physical machines, especially for tasks that require direct hardware access. This can be due to resource sharing between the host and guest machines.
- **Disk I/O Performance**: Disk I/O in virtual machines is typically slower than physical systems, especially for tasks that involve direct disk access. Virtual machines often use virtualized disk drivers, which can lead to differences in performance.
- **Network Latency**: VMs may exhibit different network latency patterns due to the use of virtualized network interfaces.

While it is harder to directly measure these performance differences without proper benchmarks, observing **CPU utilization**, **disk read/write speeds**, and **network response times** in a virtual machine can sometimes show noticeable differences compared to physical hardware.

### 2.5 **Other Hardware Indicators**

In some cases, other subtle clues can be gleaned from the hardware itself:

- **GPU Information**: Virtual machines often use virtualized GPUs (like **VMware SVGA** or **VirtualBox VBoxVGA**), which are different from physical GPU drivers.
- **ACPI Tables**: Virtual machines may use custom **ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)** tables that reveal the virtualization environment.

For example, tools like **Speccy** or **CPU-Z** can give detailed insights into your system's hardware configuration, including the GPU and motherboard information, which may reveal if you're running in a virtualized environment.

### 2.6 **Detecting Hypervisor via CPUID Instruction**

Another low-level method is querying the **CPUID** instruction to look for specific flags that indicate the presence of a hypervisor. Some VMs expose a “hypervisor present” flag in the CPUID instruction. This flag is often used by virtualization software to indicate that the operating system is running inside a virtual machine. For example, the CPUID instruction on VMware often returns a specific string like `VMwareVMware`.

However, PowerShell alone doesn’t provide a straightforward way to query CPUID directly, so you'd typically need to use a lower-level language like **C++** or **assembly** for direct access, or find a third-party tool that provides this information.

- **Microsoft Hv** : `Hyper-V`
- **KVMKVMKVM** : `KVM`
- **prl hyperv** : `Parallels`
- **VBoxVBoxVBox** : `VirtualBox`
- **VMwareVMware** : `VMWare`
- **XenVMMXenVMM** : `Xen`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

// Function to execute CPUID instruction and return the results
void cpuid(int out[4], int func) {
    __asm__ __volatile__(
        "cpuid"
        : "=a"(out[0]), "=b"(out[1]), "=c"(out[2]), "=d"(out[3])
        : "a"(func)
    );
}

// Function to detect hypervisor by checking the CPUID "hypervisor present" flag
bool is_hypervisor_present() {
    int cpuid_result[4] = {0};

    // Call CPUID with function 0x1, which returns feature flags in EDX and ECX
    cpuid(cpuid_result, 0x1);

    // The hypervisor present flag is in bit 31 of the ECX register
    bool hypervisor_present = (cpuid_result[2] & (1 << 31)) != 0;

    return hypervisor_present;
}

int main() {
    if (is_hypervisor_present()) {
        std::cout << "Hypervisor detected!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No hypervisor detected." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

### 2.7 **Analyzing Time Drift**

Virtual machines often exhibit **time drift** due to the way virtualized hardware synchronizes time with the host. This drift can become more pronounced over long periods of time. While this might not be immediately obvious, you can monitor **system uptime** and **time offsets** between the guest VM and the host. A high **time skew** can be indicative of virtualization, especially if the host system has very stable time (which physical systems generally do).

You could use PowerShell to measure **system uptime** and check if there's an unusually high drift in system time over a given period, which could be indicative of a VM.

## **Combining Methods for Effective Detection**

The most effective strategy is to combine software-based and hardware-based detection techniques. By layering these approaches, you can improve accuracy and detect even sophisticated virtualized environments.

```powershell
# Combine software and hardware checks for virtualization detection

# MAC Address Check
$vmMacPrefixes = @("00:05:69", "00:0C:29", "00:50:56", "08:00:27", "52:54:00", "00:1C:42", "00:16:3E")
$networkAdapters = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration | Where-Object { $_.IPEnabled }
$isVmDetected = $false

foreach ($adapter in $networkAdapters) {
    $macAddress = $adapter.MACAddress.ToUpper()
    foreach ($prefix in $vmMacPrefixes) {
        if ($macAddress.StartsWith($prefix)) {
            $isVmDetected = $true
            Write-Host "VM Detected: MAC Address $macAddress"
        }
    }
}

# System Manufacturer Check
$systemInfo = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem
if ($systemInfo.Manufacturer -match "VMware|VirtualBox") {
    $isVmDetected = $true
    Write-Host "VM Detected: Manufacturer $($systemInfo.Manufacturer)"
}

# BIOS Check
$biosInfo = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_BIOS
if ($biosInfo.SerialNumber -match "VMware|VirtualBox") {
    $isVmDetected = $true
    Write-Host "VM Detected: BIOS Serial $($biosInfo.SerialNumber)"
}

if ($isVmDetected) {
    Write-Host "System is running in a virtualized environment." -ForegroundColor Red
} else {
    Write-Host "System appears to be running on physical hardware." -ForegroundColor Green
}

```

 

### **Conclusion**

No single method is foolproof, as virtualization technologies evolve and anti-detection measures become more sophisticated. Hardware-based detection techniques—analyzing **CPU features**, **BIOS/EFI information**, and **system performance** metrics—can reveal whether a system is running in a virtual machine or sandbox environment. While these methods are harder to spoof than software-based techniques, they require deeper knowledge of hardware and performance characteristics.

By combining hardware checks with **software-level detection** (including **MAC address analysis**, **process checking**, and **registry inspections**), you can build a robust detection strategy that reliably identifies virtual environments.
